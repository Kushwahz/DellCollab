# DellCollab

###### Timeline | 2017-18 (Internship - Dell International Services India Pvt. Ltd.)

During my Winter Internship 2018 with DELL, I participated in an overnight Interns Hackathon where we were asked to propose ideas that would solve any problem a Dell employee faces on daily basis. We had to conduct surveys to gather the challenges Dell employees encounter, then discuss the problems and find out some ideas to solve it. We had to submit the idea prototype in the overnight development session. So I was in Bangalore and was aware of the daily traffic issues that my peers had to face during the peak hours when they leave from office. One of my team member used to wait for his friend and then he drops him to his place on his way to home. I thought if there would have been any tool that could enable Dell employees to share their ride with other employee who have common route to their homes. So an application that can enable Dell Employees for Carpooling was my idea and I developed an android application as the required prototype for the Hackathon to showcase my idea.

**DellCollab** is an android application that enable Carpooling service for employees working in the same company or IT park. It provides a way to register yourself as a vehicle owner or who needs a ride to their place. Once you register, you can specify your home address or any other address where you are heading to and if you want to pick someone or if someone else can pick you. Application requires you to specify the time when you'll be leaving for your home 2 hours before, so that people who need ride can check whether someone is heading to their way in next 2 hours so that they can accordingly plan and contact the person to meet. Following is the application workflow - 

### Carpool Givers
- Register with their contact and address details
- Specify which vehicle they own (Car or Bike)
- Specify how many seats are vacant (in case of a 4 wheeler)
- Specify the time when they'll leave (2 hours prior)
- Finally they'll make themselves available for the people to contact them
- People who will have the common route can request them for a ride

### Carpool Takers
- Register with their contact and address details
- Specify when you are planning to leave
- You'll will be presented with the list of people who are leaving in the next 2 hours window
- The list will show the Route Match % for all the shown Carpool givers
- Based on your latest availability to get the pickup you can contact the rider
